# Forest Cover Type Classification:
A machine learning project to classify the type of forest cover based on various geographic and environmental features.

## Project Overview:
This project addresses a multi-class classification problem using machine learning models to predict the forest cover type of a given area.

The models are trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes topographical and geological data. 

The goal is to build an accurate and robust classifier that can correctly identify one of the seven cover types.

## Dataset:

-The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains a wide range of features related to forest land, including:

Elevation,Aspect,Slope,Horizontal and Vertical distances to hydrology,Horizontal distance to roadways,Soil type and Wilderness area.

-The data consists of 581,012 observations with 54 features, making it a large-scale classification problem suitable for benchmarking various models.

## Workflow:

-Data Loading and Initial Exploration: The dataset is loaded, and initial checks are performed for data types, missing values, and summary statistics.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations are used to understand the distribution of features and the relationships between them, particularly with the Cover_Type target variable.

-Feature Engineering and Preprocessing: The data is prepared for modeling by scaling the numerical features using StandardScaler to ensure that no single feature dominates the model's training process.

-Model Selection and Training: Multiple classification models are trained and evaluated, including:
Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier and Logistic Regression.

-Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is assessed using key metrics such as Accuracy, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix to understand how well each model predicts the different forest cover types.

## Results:

The Random Forest Classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy, outperforming both the XGBoost and Logistic Regression models. 

This highlights the effectiveness of ensemble methods for this complex classification problem.
